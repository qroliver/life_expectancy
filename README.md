This is a project where I do an initial exploratory analysis of the impact of various socioeconomic factors on global life expectancy at birth. 
To do this, I used different R packages designed to collect data from various sources, such as the World Bank and the WHO, as well as to fetch data from internet, such as rvest,
to collect data from the UN.
